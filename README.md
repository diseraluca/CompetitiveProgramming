# CompetitiveProgramming
A repository for my solutions to competitive programming problems exercise.


This repository will contain all of my solutions to some competitive programming problems that I'm tackling as an exercise in the small free time from my free-study time I can find.
The problems will mainly come from *UVa Online Judges* or *Hackerranks*, with an idea to move to *Codeforce* and/or *ProjectEuler* too at some point in time.

The main language for the solution will be *C++* but, as an additional exercise and a form of learning, I'm trying to solve, and as such provide, solutions in the *Factor* programming language too. 

For now at least, the solutions will not care too much about performance and are expected to be "As fast as the minumum requirement or more" to be acceptable by my current standard.
For *Factor* solutions specifically, I may take some more liberties with the algorithm used for the solution.
